# Amazon-Web-Scraping-And-Product-Analysis

Welcome to my analysis of the products on Amazon.com! In this project, I aim to identify the best options among the many search results on the site. I have divided the project into two parts:

## [Part A: Scrape Amazon Product Review](https://github.com/Johneration/Amazon-Web-Scraping-And-Product-Analysis/blob/main/1.%20scrape_amazon_product_review.ipynb)
> In the first part of the project, I created a script to scrape the reviews for each search result in order to gather the necessary data. This enabled us to collect a large and diverse dataset to work with. By passing in different search terms, the script collected valuable information such as star ratings, comments, and prices of each product. [A demo video of the scraping process can be found here!](https://github.com/Johneration/Amazon-Web-Scraping-And-Product-Analysis/blob/main/web-scraper-demo-video.mp4?raw=true)

## [Part B: Analyze Amazon Product Review](https://github.com/Johneration/Amazon-Web-Scraping-And-Product-Analysis/blob/main/2.%20analyze_amazon_product_review.ipynb)
> In the second part, I analyzed the scraped data and used various techniques to select the best products. My goal was to identify patterns and trends in the data and use them to make informed decisions. To demonstrate this, I used the script to scrape the reviews for the following search terms: guitar, keyboard piano, and drum. I have also created various plots to visualize the findings.

Overall, this project provides a comprehensive analysis of the products on Amazon and can be used by consumers to make confident and informed purchasing decisions.
