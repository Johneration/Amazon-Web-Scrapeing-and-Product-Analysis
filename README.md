# Amazon-Web-Scraping-And-Product-Analysis

## Introduction

Welcome to my analysis of the products on Amazon.com! In this project, I set out to identify the best options among the many search results on the site. To do this, I divided the project into two parts.

## [Part A: Scrape Amazon Product Review](https://github.com/Johneration/Amazon-Web-Scraping-And-Product-Analysis/blob/main/1.%20scrape_amazon_product_review.ipynb)
> In the first part of the project, I created a script to scrape the reviews for each search result in order to gather the necessary data. This allowed us to collect a large and diverse dataset to work with. By passing in different search terms, the script collected valuable information such as the star ratings, comments, and price of each product. This data was then used in the second part of the project to analyze and select the best options. [A demo video of the scraping process can be found here!](https://github.com/Johneration/Amazon-Web-Scraping-And-Product-Analysis/blob/main/web-scraper-demo-video.mp4?raw=true)

## [Part B: Analyze Amazon Product Review](https://github.com/Johneration/Amazon-Web-Scraping-And-Product-Analysis/blob/main/2.%20analyze_amazon_product_review.ipynb)
> In the second part, I analyzed the scraped data and used various techniques to select the best products. The goal was to identify patterns and trends in the data and use them to make informed decisions. To demostrate this, I used the script to scrape the reviews for the following search terms: guitar, keyboard piano and drum. I've also created various plots to visualize our findings.

Overall, this project provides a comprehensive analysis of the products on Amazon and can be used by consumers to make confident and informed purchasing decisions.
